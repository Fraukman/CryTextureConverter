CryTextureConverter
A simple and efficient desktop tool built with Python, PyQt5, and OpenCV to convert PBR texture maps from the Metallic/Roughness workflow to the Specular/Glossiness workflow, optimized for CryEngine.

ðŸš€ Features:

Load and preview multiple texture maps (Diffuse, AO, Opacity, Normal, Roughness, Metallic, Displacement)

Generate CryEngine-ready Albedo, Specular, Gloss, Normal, and Displacement textures

Automatically combines maps (e.g. Diffuse Ã— AO + Opacity as Alpha)

Easy-to-use interface with clear visual feedback

Saves output textures with CryEngine-compatible naming conventions

ðŸŽ¯ Perfect for artists and technical developers transitioning assets to CryEngine.
